						<h2>Make code not war</h2>
						<p> <br>“Well, writing novels is incredibly simple: an author sits down…and writes.</br>

<br>Granted, most writers I know are a bit strange.</br>

<br>Some, downright weird.</br>

<br>But then again, you’d have to be.</br>

<br>To spend hundreds and hundreds of hours sitting in front of a computer screen staring at lines of information is pretty tedious. More like a computer programmer. And no matter how cool the Matrix made looking at code seem, computer programmers are even weirder than authors.” 
― Christopher Hopper</br></p>

						<h2> why you should start learning to code ?</h2>
						<p>A new report from Burning Glass, a job market analytics firm, found that there were as many as 7 million job openings in 2015 in occupations that required coding skills. They also found that programming jobs overall are growing 12% faster than the market average.<br />
						However, there is not a lot of people who pursuit a degree in coding  which will increase the chance of a coder to have a job fastly.<br />

									<h3>want some motivation to start yout journey</h3>
									<p> As Muhammed ali said:"" impossible is potentiel. impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing". Don't be scared to take a risk because you can have in that risk fun. Coding may seem for some people very hard, but if you have the motivation to take your coding skills to the next level, you will definetly successed.<br/>
									 As Albert Einstein:"A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new". Don't fear to make mistakes because it helps to improve your skills. You have to take mistake as a way to be better to improve yourself. Don't panic every single coder has definetly make a lot of mistakes.<br/>
							         As Linus Torvalds said:"most good programmers do programming not because they except to get paid or get adulation   by the public, but it is fun to program". Make as a first goal to have fun because it will help to innovate and find solution of the community then money will come.  </br>
									And the most important thing is to be happy and self-satisfated of what you are doing.

						<h2>Get to learn the 21st century language</h2>
						<p>There is so many website that give the opportunity to beginner to learn how to code in a simple way and advanced lessons to people who have already a knowledge about computer science. For me, it is the best way to get to know computer science. <br />
						So you have to find the website who  has the same way of learning as yours. You can check codeacademy,w3school ,khanacademy... </p>

								<h3> About me.</h3>
								<p>Hello again, in this is part you are going to know more about me. My name is Ali Nacir and I am from kenitra,Morocco. I am a high scool student who is interested in reading, computer programming, travelling and playing soccer. I am also interested in opportunities like camps and events.  
								<p>  As a lot of people, I did not know much about coding until I went to high school. Back then, I did know just the purpose of coding which means that I don'nt know even how a code looks like. When I got to high school, I decided to change the school. And that school that I got to have computer science class. Comparing to my other friends who has already started coding, I was not in the level to keeping out with my classmates. I decided to focus with the teacher as much as I can during the class. But my plan did not work out like I was expected.  </p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
							<br>
							<br>
								<p>  The class of computer programming didn't exceed 2 hours a week. And,the teacher want us to learn in as much programs as possible. So we got to jump from a program to another before we got to learn all his aspects. At the end of the year, I forgot everything about computer programming. And the computer science class ends in the 10th, so it was my last chance for me to learn computer science at school and I was not in the level that I want to be. </p>
								
								<p>I decided to start learning computer science by myself. First, I did not know which website I will use. So,I kept searching for the website  where I can learn mora fastly. I sign up for a class in EDX called CS50 that I found very special and the teacher give the lessons in a way I did not get bored. I also started python in codeacademy which start step by step to make you learn the program that you want.</p>
								
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
							<br>
							<br>
								<p>As I said I am very interested in opportunities. In that summer,while I was surfing on the net. I found a very interesting opportunity in Morocco. It was a computer science camp. In fact, it was the first computer science camp in Morocco. I was very excited because that camp will connect the dots that I had at school. And from 264 persons who applied. We were 24 who got accepted, 12 girls and 12 boys.  </p>
								<p>It was a great experience to be part of the first edition of e-ntitiate camp. We met other people who are interested in computer science and I got to know each  and who got different levels in programming. In the camp we learnt python and Html. Special thanks to the monitors,the staff, the volunteers and escpecially the teachers who give their free time to help us. </p>
